Eye Movement Exercise
Uploaded October 20, 2021

This program will display an animated pair of eyes that
follow the mouse arrow.

To run this program download all correlating files from my GitHub Repository to a single folder 
then drag and drop the html file into your browser.

In the future i plan on adding a mouth animation that 
responds to clicks.

I do not own rights to the images or code in this program.

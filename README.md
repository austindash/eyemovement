This program will display an animated pair of eyes that
follow the mouse arrow.

To run this program download all correlating files from my GitHub Repository to a single folder 
then drag and drop the html file into your browser.

In the future i plan on adding a mouth animation that 
responds to clicks.

I do not own rights to the images or code in this program.

Most of this program is coded and distributed according to MIT license.
